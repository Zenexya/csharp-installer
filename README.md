# C# Installer
Source used for installing your own software through WebClient

# Setting it up
All you need to do is just edit the variables to your links. The code written below will do everything else for you.
If you want to change the text, please make sure you have at least some experience in C#, otherwise it might break the code.
No need to credit me, however please don't say that you made it by yourself. This is considered stealing and is illegal, right?
You can also use this source for learning purposes, or to make your own bootstrapper / software installer.

Have fun!
